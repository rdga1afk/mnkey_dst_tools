deepseek_terrain_kenshi_survey_research.py — 30-річний історичний огляд
прикладів побудови поверхні ландшафту в іграх "в дусі" Kenshi (не
AAA-blockbuster з необмеженим бюджетом, а sandbox/open-world/RPG на
скромнішому рушії) через DeepSeek API.

Контекст: два попередні дослідження цієї сесії (deepseek_terrain_geometry_
research.py, deepseek_terrain_perf_research.py) були вузько сфокусовані на
конкретних технічних проблемах нашого движка. Це третє — ширший історичний/
порівняльний огляд за трьома критеріями (оригінальність, продуктивність,
популярність), щоб зрозуміти контекст: що з відомого за 30 років найбільше
заслуговує на увагу для проєкту схожого профілю з Kenshi.

games, with a DELIBERATE focus on titles with a similar profile to Kenshi:
small-to-mid budget, open-world or large-map sandbox/RPG/survival games,

approximate year, the core algorithm (ROAM, geomipmapping, chunked LOD,
CDLOD, geometry clipmaps, quadtree, brushed/sculpted heightfields, voxel/
marching-cubes terrain, etc.), and why it mattered at the time. Cover at
minimum: the Tribes/Genesis3D-era chunked terrain LOD wave (~1998-2002),
Trespasser's terrain (technically ambitious but infamous), early Bethesda/
Gamebryo-style terrain (Morrowind/Oblivion era), the ROAM/geomipmapping
academic techniques and which shipped games actually used them, mid-2000s
Source/CryEngine/Frostbite terrain, the indie/small-team terrain wave

Stardew-adjacent simpler approaches, Kenshi's own Ogre3D terrain ~2013-2018
development), and 2010s-2020s CDLOD-descendant systems (Horizon Zero Dawn,
Ghost of Tsushima, No Man's Sky's procedural approach as a contrast case).

novel (compare explicitly to what came before), the real game/engine/paper
it came from, and whether the idea was later widely copied or remained a
one-off curiosity. Consider strong candidates such as: ROAM (Duchaineau et
al. 1997, academic but hugely influential), geometry clipmaps (Losasso &
Hoppe 2004 / Microsoft, used in Flight Simulator), Trespasser's terrain
deformation and physics-driven approach (1998, ambitious but poorly

original idea (2009-2011), No Man's Sky's fully procedural planet-scale
terrain (2016), Dwarf Fortress's abstracted/simulation-first terrain

given Kenshi's own simulation-heavy design philosophy), and any other

day). This is the most directly relevant criterion for our low-end Intel

that shipped it, and concrete evidence of its efficiency (real triangle/
draw-call budgets, target hardware, frame-rate achieved, or direct
engineering commentary from the developers if you have real knowledge of
it). Consider: geomipmapping's original appeal (cheap, simple, ran on late-
90s/early-2000s hardware), chunked LOD (Ulrich, used in various indie/mid-
budget titles precisely because it was cheap to implement and run),
Minecraft's greedy-meshing voxel optimization (a real, well-documented
performance technique for a very different terrain representation),
mobile/handheld terrain techniques (which had to be extremely frugal --
any notable examples), and any small-team open-world game you know shipped
convincing large-scale terrain on genuinely modest hardware budgets similar

technique can be popular because it is simply the well-understood, safe,
widely-taught choice. Consider: geomipmapping/chunked-LOD-family techniques
as the most widely reimplemented pattern in open-source engines (OGRE,
Urho3D/rbfx, Godot's various terrain plugins, countless tutorials and
hobbyist implementations) precisely because they are simple to explain and
implement, CDLOD (Strugar) specifically as a technique that became a
near-default reference point cited by a disproportionate number of later
implementations relative to how recently it was published, Unity Terrain
and Unreal Landscape as the two most POPULAR terrain systems by sheer
number of shipped titles (because they are the built-in defaults in the
two most widely used commercial engines, not necessarily because they are
the most sophisticated), and voxel-based terrain (Minecraft-inspired) as
its own separate popularity wave especially in the indie space post-2011.

this profile and describe (to the extent you have real knowledge) how
their terrain was actually built -- even if public technical detail is
thin, say what IS publicly known versus what is reasonable inference.

Mount & Blade series (own custom engine, similarly rugged/functional
terrain, small original team), Dwarf Fortress (abstracted terrain but
extreme simulation depth, the philosophical peer even if not visually
comparable), RimWorld (much smaller scale but same small-team-simulation-
first design philosophy), Project Zomboid, Wurm Online/Unlimited (small
team, large persistent open world, notably janky but functional terrain --
a real cautionary/comparison case), and any other small-team open-world
sandbox/RPG you have genuine knowledge of. Explicitly rank how Kenshi's

read and study directly (source available, not just papers/talks about a
closed engine). For each: the real repo, whether it is still actively
maintained (2025-2026), the terrain system's actual architecture (heightfield/
mesh representation, LOD scheme, whether it is CDLOD-descended or something
else), and how mature/production-proven it is (shipped real games, or
mostly a tech demo). Cover explicitly:
- O3DE (Open 3D Engine, Linux Foundation, originally Amazon Lumberyard/
  CryEngine-derived) -- its terrain gem/system specifically: architecture,
  how it differs from CryEngine's original terrain (which O3DE's lineage
  traces back to), whether it's a good reference despite being a much
  larger/heavier engine than ours.
- Godot's Terrain3D plugin (already partially covered in this session's
  prior geometry research, but revisit specifically for how mature/
  production-proven it is as of 2025-2026, and any real games shipped with it).
- rbfx / Urho3D's Terrain component (already covered in this session's
  prior research -- do not repeat in depth, just note it for completeness).
- Bevy Engine's terrain ecosystem (Rust, ECS-based, ecosystem of third-party
  terrain plugins rather than one built-in system -- name the most credible
  ones if you have real knowledge).
- Stride3D (formerly Xenko) -- terrain support if any.
- Any other genuinely real, currently public open-source engine with a
  terrain system worth knowing about that you have real knowledge of
  (do not pad the list with engines you are unsure still exist or are
  unsure have real terrain code).
For each, explicitly assess: is this a realistic thing for a small project
like ours (C++17, custom SDL_GPU HAL, not adopting a whole external engine)

with its own engine to extract cleanly? Be honest if an engine is not
actually a good fit despite being well-known.""",
