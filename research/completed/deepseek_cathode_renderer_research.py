deepseek_cathode_renderer_research.py — reconstruct how the Cathode-engine
renderer works from raw Ghidra-decompiled pseudo-C, for two real shipped
titles built on it: Viking: Battle for Asgard (2008, D3D9, PS3/X360) and
Alien: Isolation (2014, D3D11/D3D10, the engine's mature form). Companion
research to this project's own FPS/resolution investigation (South Hive
FPS bug, terrain-shading cost measurements) -- the motivating question is
concrete: both titles hit 1080p60-class targets on hardware not
meaningfully better than our own Intel HD 520 target, so what does their
actual per-frame architecture look like, and does any of it transfer.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS INSTEAD OF CLAUDE CALLING THE API DIRECTLY: same
platform-level block as tools/research/deepseek_render_vs_openmw_research.py
-- an AI agent is hard-blocked from autonomously sending source (here:
decompiled binary source, arguably more sensitive) to an external API.
Claude prepared this script and the excerpt files below; a human must run
it. Same DeepSeek account/model already used this session.

SOURCE MATERIAL: re_/VBfA/viking.exe.c (470K lines, raw Ghidra output, zero
prior renaming -- ~10.7K anonymous FUN_xxxxxxxx functions) and
re_/AI/AI.exe.c (2.7M lines, same situation). Neither file is small enough
to hand to a model whole, and neither is indexed by this project's
jCodemunch code-navigation MCP (both come back with zero symbols -- too
large / not treated as a real "language" by the indexer). Claude manually
traced call graphs from known anchor points (Direct3DCreate9 /
D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain, the Win32 message-pump functions, the
per-tick subsystem-dispatch function in VBfA) and extracted the resulting
excerpts to the files below. It also pulled real engine-internal string
literals (RenderPass_PreHILOAlpha, GBuffer, setShadowMapResolution,
VelocityPass, RayleighMieSkyShader, etc.) via grep -- these are the
engine's OWN names, not Ghidra's auto-naming, and are the highest-signal
evidence extracted so far.

USAGE (run this yourself, e.g. via `! python3 ...` in the Claude Code
session, or from a plain terminal):

    "binary built on Creative Assembly's 'Cathode' engine, plus a list of "
    "real engine-internal string literals recovered from the same binary "
    "(these ARE the engine's own names, trustworthy unlike the Ghidra "
    "auto-names). Your job: reconstruct as much of the real renderer "
    "architecture and per-frame flow as the evidence supports. Be explicit "
    "about confidence -- distinguish 'directly shown in the excerpt' from "
    "'inferred from Win32/D3D API semantics' from 'speculative from string "
    "names alone'. Do not invent function purposes you cannot support. "
    "Where the excerpt is truncated or a called function's body wasn't "
    "provided, say so rather than guessing its contents.\n\n"
    "Context for why this matters: the requester maintains a small custom "
    "C++17/SDL_GPU indie engine (Vulkan via SDL_GPU, direct command-buffer "
    "HAL, no scene-graph, deferred+forward hybrid, screen-space terrain "
    "shading) targeting Intel HD 520 (2015 integrated GPU, 24 EU, ~15W "
    "package power budget shared between CPU+GPU) at 1920x1080 60fps for "
    "an open-world game with real terrain, NPCs, foliage, and shadows. "
    "Measured current reality: GPU pins at 100% (976-1000/1000MHz) at "
    "1920x1056 with an almost-empty test scene (bare terrain, no foliage/"
    "buildings, minimal shadow casters), yielding only 34-47fps -- a ~25-35% "
    "GPU-cost overshoot versus the 16.6ms/frame budget, worsened by CPU "
    "downclocking (2300->1800MHz) under the same shared power budget. "
    "The titles you are analyzing shipped real open-world (Viking) or "
    "densely-detailed (Alien: Isolation) content at comparable or better "
    "resolution/framerate targets on hardware from their own era that was "
    "not dramatically more powerful in raw FLOPS than a modern low-power "
    "iGPU. Where the evidence supports it, call out anything that looks "
    "like a deliberate CPU/GPU balance decision, and anything that looks "
    "like it would NOT be safe or sensible on a shared-power-budget iGPU."
