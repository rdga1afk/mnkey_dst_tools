deepseek_ogre_next_terra_normal_mip_research.py -- deep follow-up to task
#437's DeepSeek research on OGRE-Next's Terra terrain system, now scoped
tightly to ONE concrete, verified structural difference this session found
by reading real source on both sides (not the earlier, partly-unverified
"from memory" pass -- see docs/research/OGRE_NEXT_TERRA_DEEPSEEK_RESEARCH.md
in git history, commit 81a9cf06, self-flagged as working from memory
rather than a checkout).

Same methodology and same data-handling boundary as
deepseek_render_vs_granite_research.py -- see that file's own doc comment
for the full rationale (short version: an AI agent must not autonomously
send this repo's proprietary render architecture to an external API;
running this script requires the human to type the command themselves).

VERIFIED FACTS (real source read this session, 2026-08-29):
  - Our TerrainWorldHeightmap::normal_tex_ (engine/src/render/
    terrain_world_heightmap.cpp) is created with `nti.num_levels = 1` --
    NO mip chain at all, RG8_SNORM, baked once by
    shaders/terrain_worldmap_normal_bake.comp. The sampler
    (normal_sampler_) sets mipmap_mode=NEAREST, which is moot with only
    one level -- every LOD/distance always samples the exact same
    full-native-resolution normal texel grid.
  - By contrast, our HEIGHT texture (tex_, same file) DOES get a full mip
    chain (`ti.num_levels` = floor(log2(N))+1, filled via
    SDL_GenerateMipmapsForGPUTexture) and IS sampled via hardware
    trilinear mip sampling at a per-vertex computed fractional LOD (per
    terrain_world_heightmap.h's own doc comment: "hardware trilinear mip
    sampling ... never from a per-window texture").
  - Real OGRE-Next Terra.cpp (Samples/2.0/Tutorials/Tutorial_Terrain/src/
    Terra/Terra.cpp, createNormalTexture(), fetched via `gh api` this
    session) does the opposite: `m_normalMapTex->setNumMipmaps(
    PixelFormatGpuUtils::getMaxMipmapCount(...))` gives the normal texture
    a FULL mip chain matched to the height texture's resolution, using
    TextureFlags::AllowAutomipmaps on a temp RTT (box-filtered downsample
    of the ENCODED unit-normal texture, not re-derived from height per
    mip), then explicitly copies each mip level in
    (`for i in 0..numMipmaps: tmpRtt->copyTo(m_normalMapTex, ..., i, ...)`).
  - Open project bug: task #556 "Cliff speckle: live repro + shader
    root-cause" (pending) -- reproduced visually via
    tests/editor_scenarios/editor_verify_bw_pattern_ab.lua /
    editor_verify_bw_pattern_z34_36.lua ("black/white speckle" on steep
    cliff faces). Root cause not yet confirmed.
  - A prior, different session already investigated and flagged a
    DIFFERENT candidate fix for the same symptom class: storing a
    2-channel (dh/dx, dh/dz) slope map instead of a unit-normal texture,
    reasoning that slopes filter linearly under mip averaging while unit
    normals can cancel toward garbage on downsample -- this was flagged
    as *DeepSeek's own suggestion*, not something read from real Terra
    source, and has NOT been falsification-tested yet.

    "fact driving this investigation: our baked normal texture has "
    "num_levels=1 (no mip chain at all, always sampled at native "
    "resolution regardless of camera distance or LOD tier), while our "
    "height texture DOES have a full mip chain sampled via a per-vertex "
    "fractional LOD, AND real OGRE-Next Terra also gives its normal "
    "texture a full mip chain matched to height resolution (via "
    "AllowAutomipmaps + explicit per-mip RTT copy in createNormalTexture()). "
    "Assess whether this height-LOD/normal-single-level mismatch is a "
    "plausible or likely root cause of the speckle symptom -- reason "
    "through the actual mechanism (what happens when a low-poly, "
    "coarse-height-LOD triangle on a steep cliff is shaded using a normal "
    "sampled at full native-texel resolution, texel-for-texel, with no "
    "distance-appropriate smoothing). Also assess honestly whether "
    "copying OGRE-Next's exact fix (box-filtered automipmaps of the "
    "encoded normal texture) is itself correct, or whether it has its own "
    "known flattening risk on steep slopes (unit normals can partially "
    "cancel under naive box-filter averaging) that would trade one "
    "artifact for another -- and if so, compare against the untested "
    "alternative already on file: storing a 2-channel slope map "
    "(dh/dx, dh/dz) instead of a unit-normal texture, since slopes filter "
    "linearly under mip averaging. Give a genuinely honest verdict, not a "
